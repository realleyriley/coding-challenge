# Coding Challenge

Your goal is to create a small react application using the [SpaceX open GraphQL api](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/). You can write the components yourself, or you can use a component library like [AntDesign](https://ant.design/components/overview/).

Do not to spend more than 6hrs on this. If you don't finish everything, that is okay! We just want to know how far you got, where you had trouble, and how proficient you are at your craft. If you get stuck, write a little note in the in the `NOTES.md` file about it, and move on. If you have design questions: (for example: What format should I display the date in?) just use your best judgement.

As far as the design of the application goes. You can do whatever you want. Multiple pages, 1 long page, modals and drawers... whatever you think will make the information the most useful. Feel free to make it your own.

## Getting Started

- [ ] clone this repo
- [ ] create a branch with you name as the branch name
  - everything you do should take place in this branch.

## Application Requirements

- [ ] I can see a list of "launches" including the following information about the launch:
  - [ ] id
  - [ ] details
  - [ ] launch success
  - [ ] launch date
  - [ ] links
    - [ ] images from flickr
    - [ ] link to video
  - [ ] the rocket used
    - [ ] rocket name
    - [ ] rocket type
- [ ] I can search the list of launches
  - NOTE: search can use any level "opperation" (ie: `_eq`, `_like`, `_similar`)

## Extra Credit.

- [ ] I can **create** a user with a `name` and `twitter` handle
- [ ] I can **search** for "users"
- [ ] paginate the results of one of the searches (launches or users)

## Submitting:

- [ ] submit a pull-request in github (to master) for you branch.
- [ ] email us when you are done!
